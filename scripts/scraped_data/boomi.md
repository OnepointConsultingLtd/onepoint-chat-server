ENHANCING BOOMI AI

## Onepoint AI Ecosystem for Boomi

We are excited tolaunchthe Onepoint AI Ecosystem for Boomi— a comprehensive suite of solution components built to simplify and supercharge enterprise automation on the Boomi platform.

[launch](/onepoint-ai-ecosystem-for-boomi/)

With over 20 years of experience delivering enterprise-grade solutions, we understand the challenges businesses face when it comes to integrating AI into complex environments. That’s why we’ve developed theOnepoint AI Ecosystem for Boomi: a practical, layered toolkit that helps organisations move faster, reduce manual effort, and unlock real value with Artificial Intelligence on the Boomi platform.

Our AI Connectors are the “nuts and bolts” of the Onepoint AI Ecosystem — secure, Boomi-native integrations that connect AI agents to the systems, databases, and tools your enterprise relies on.

These connectors make it easy to build intelligent, agentic workflows without adding technical debt.

Sitting on top of our AI Connectors, Onepoint AI Components are modular building blocks designed to handle tasks that typically require human input — streamlining decision-making and execution across workflows.

For example, these components help you:

- Interpret and analyse data
- Detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Generate SQL dynamically and contextually

By combining flexibility with intelligence, these components accelerate automation while maintaining control and transparency across processes.

At the top layer of our ecosystem sit the Onepoint AI Apps — production-ready solutions that combine our connectors and components into intelligent, extensible workflows.  Each AI App is designed to tackle real business challenges.

Connect data better with Boomi Data Hub

Every organisation is looking to get more out of mastering data. While this means different things to different organsiations, to many, at its core this means one or more of:

- being more agile in mastering and working with data, realising return on investment on data projects within weeks, not months or years;
- lowering the total cost of ownership, by avoiding the expense and heartaches of ‘old school’ master data management products locked within data domains and organisational silos; and
- improving operational efficiency, by breaking through silos and creating 360˚ visibility across products, customers, colleagues, and partners.

Solving for the data mastering challenge requires insights into the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of your data. We start with a Onepoint Springboard™ design thinking workshop with multidisciplinary stakeholders from your organisation to understand what you are looking to achieve. Then we rapidly model the master data entities, add your models to a central hub repository, and absorb data from source systems. Finally, we establish real-time, bidirectional business rules to keep the hub and source systems in sync.

The Boomi Data Hub allows us to deploy a best-inclass, cloud-native data management solution that sits at the centre of the various data silos within your business — including your existing Data Hub solution(s), to provide you a scalable, flexible, and secure master data management hub as a service that is architected and implemented rapidly by Onepoint’s world class data experts.

Connect applications better with Boomi API Management

Organisations are on a journey to improve interactions with their customers, partners and lines of business. They are losing time and money when their applications are unable to talk to one another or anyone else’s. They are looking to modernise applications because:

- IT departments are doing slow, manual integrationsto legacy applications and new cloud services to provide new functionality;
- connecting applications to the outside securely and rapidly is becoming business criticalto enable new revenue streams or to respond to customer and competitor pressures; and
- scaling and managing APIs is appearing on the transformation agenda.

Figuring out how your enterprise can gain full control of APIs starts with a Onepoint Springboard™ design thinking workshop. Multidisciplinary stakeholders from your organisation and our experts get a handle on your business and technical drivers. We start small, configuring selected APIs through a web-based, visual experience. Then we deploy APIs with comprehensive security and authentication. Finally, we monitor the health of your APIs and web services with usage dashboards and engage API developers with a catalog and developer portal.

With the Boomi API Management product, Onepoint’s experts quickly put in place a solution that supports the full lifecycle of APIs. We don’t stop there. We establish a unified strategy that aligns your API needs with your overarching integration and governance processes, including data, covering on premises, in the cloud or on the edge.
