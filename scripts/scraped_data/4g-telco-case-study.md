### 4G Telco Case Study

The client is UK’s largest commercial holder of national radio spectrum suitable for 4G mobile services and fixed wireless solutions, they were also the first broadband company who switched on the 4G LTE system for commercial services in the UK in February 2012 in London. The client with its 4G LTE wireless services has an extensive holding of national radio spectrum, can deliver high-capacity Next Generation Access broadband and mobile data services to help meet needs such as efficient mobile working, digital and social inclusion, re-deployable surveillance, community healthcare and education, as well as city and rural, home and business broadband access.

The client is pursuing a strategy of acquisition and introducing new products/ services. It requires to understand if the architecture of its enterprise is sufficient to execute its business strategy. If there are gaps in the architecture of the enterprise it requires to identify building blocks that will fill the gaps, the roadmap that will enable it to progress to its desired state and the cost of implementing the roadmap.

Onepoint Consulting used a structured methodology based on TOGAF to document the current business, Information (System & Data) and technology architecture. Frameworx from TMForum (https://www.tmforum.org/tm-forum-frameworx/) was used to define the target architecture. The models were analysed to identify the gaps and produce a list of prioritized business and technology initiatives and a high level transition plan. A cost was then assigned to build and operate the proposed initiatives.

The models of the current and target architecture, the transition roadmap and the total cost of ownership of implementing the roadmap enabled UK Broadband to decide strategies worth pursuing to meet its business goals and objectives. It enabled them to calculate the Return on Investment on their various strategies and make informed decision.
