## Shashin Shah

### Founder and Chief Executive Officer

### Founder and Chief Executive Officer

- 

Shashin Shah has over 35 years’ experience in delivering technology and strategies, architectures and systems. He is a creative and inspiring leader.

Born in Uganda, Shashin landed in the UK as a young man after Idi Amin expelled Asian peoples from the east African country. With few possessions, he had to start again from scratch.

Shashin graduated in Computer Science at London’s Brunel University and since then has tirelessly offered up his skills to charity, supporting causes at home and abroad. In 2016 he received the Bharat Gaurav Award for his charity work in India – introducing technology in a sensitive way to communities built on ancient Indian values.

Before founding Onepoint in 2005, Shashin was a Technical Director at Arthur Andersen /Deloitte, where he played a key role in the development of the architecture and integration practice and acted as lead architect for multiple clients.

Shashin specialises in enterprise architecture and integration, IT strategy, technology governance, big data and open-source software. Past projects have seen him work across a full industry spread, from communications to automotive, finance, transport, utilities, consumer, broadcasting and media.

Alongside his Onepoint duties, Shashin has led the architecture stream for major multi-million-pound transformation projects for clients such as Carphone Warehouse / Talk Talk, AOL Broadband and Tesco Telecom. Shashin was also the interim IT Director at UK Broadband and acting Project Director for the Talend implementation at both Axalta and the TUI Group.

As Programme Director for the SDL CX Programme at Reliance Jio in India, he helped to implement and stabilise a multi-million-pound technology programme in Mumbai.

A keen walker and a daily meditator; a badminton ace and a martial artist, as MD of Onepoint, Shashin Shah oversees all projects – from client work to in-house mentoring, training and education programmes.

His extensive experience and successful track record ensure that digital transformation is a smooth, successful and cost-effective process. Whoever the client, whatever the industry, Shashin and Onepoint ensure that you are not just prepared for the future, you’re able to embrace and define it.
