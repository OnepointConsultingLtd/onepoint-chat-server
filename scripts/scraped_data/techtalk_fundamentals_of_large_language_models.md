This primer will equip you with a foundational understanding of how LLMs like ChatGPT work under the hood.

In future sessions we’ll build on what’s covered here and get into more advanced concepts and technical details.

- What is Generative AI and how does it work?
- How are LLMs constructed and trained?
- What are the key capabilities and limitations of LLMs?
- Why does this matter (why should I care)?

- The session is 1 hour long.
- The main presentation will be 45 minutes.
- We set aside 15 minutes at the end to cover audience questions. Have a question that you’d like to submit in advance? Email us attechtalk@onepointltd.com.
