# 4G Telco Case Study

## Client Overview
The client is the UK's largest commercial holder of national radio spectrum suitable for 4G mobile services and fixed wireless solutions. They were the first broadband company to switch on the 4G LTE system for commercial services in the UK in February 2012 in London.

With its 4G LTE wireless services and extensive holding of national radio spectrum, the client can deliver high-capacity Next Generation Access broadband and mobile data services to help meet needs such as:
- Efficient mobile working
- Digital and social inclusion
- Re-deployable surveillance
- Community healthcare and education
- City and rural, home and business broadband access

## Challenge
The client is pursuing a strategy of acquisition and introducing new products/services. They needed to understand if the architecture of their enterprise was sufficient to execute their business strategy. If there were gaps in the architecture, they required:
- Identification of building blocks to fill those gaps
- A roadmap enabling progress to the desired state
- The cost of implementing the roadmap

## Solution
Onepoint Consulting used a structured methodology based on TOGAF to document the current:
- Business architecture
- Information architecture (System & Data)
- Technology architecture

[Frameworx from TMForum](https://www.tmforum.org/tm-forum-frameworx/) was used to define the target architecture. The models were analyzed to identify the gaps and produce:
- A list of prioritized business and technology initiatives
- A high-level transition plan
- Cost assignments for building and operating the proposed initiatives

## Results
The deliverables provided to the client included:
- Models of the current architecture
- Models of the target architecture
- A transition roadmap
- Total cost of ownership analysis for implementing the roadmap

These enabled the client to:
- Decide which strategies were worth pursuing to meet business goals and objectives
- Calculate the Return on Investment for various strategies
- Make informed decisions about their technology direction
