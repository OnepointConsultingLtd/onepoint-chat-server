# Belfast City Council

## Overview

Our client is a UK local authority serving an estimated population of 333,871 in a region comprising six district councils based in dormitory commuter towns. These combined councils provide services and infrastructure for a total population of 579,276, having invested £50 million into infrastructure development in 2016 alone. This investment is essential for the region's prosperity, as tourism and business footfall generated £324 million towards the city's economy, representing an annual increase of 14%.

## Business Challenge

Maximising business rate revenue was the key objective of this project, as:

- Rate income provides important revenue for the Central Government Executive and associated District Councils
- Non-domestic rate income provides approximately half of the total revenues for the Council
- It is vital to maximize yield from the existing tax base to promote regional development
- The stagnant rate base was deemed to be out of control

## Project Objectives

The key requirements were to:

- Identify the occupancy status of non-domestic properties
- Ensure all existing rateable properties are on the Valuation List
- Confirm the use of non-domestic properties
- Expedite the time period from a property becoming rateable to the issuance of the rate bill
- Utilize data to increase rates of payment compliance

## Onepoint's Approach

In conjunction with partners 'The Behaviouralist', Onepoint presented a 2-step solution incorporating data science, behavioral science, experimentation techniques, and software development expertise:

**Step 1:** Development of a digital data hub to maintain up-to-date property occupancy status data and business rate registrations using ETL, analytics, web scraping and data streaming tools.

**Step 2:** Refining and enriching this dataset with additional proprietary datasets to understand the payment rates and registration accuracy for current businesses.

**Advanced Data Matching and Analysis:** This involved deterministic and probabilistic linking of several critical datasets using advanced techniques such as data normalization, fuzzy matching and text stemming. The team employed the Talend data processing platform to generate:

- A database of over 1,600 unregistered businesses occupying non-domestic properties
- More than 2,700 unregistered businesses occupying residential properties
- Over 200 unregistered charities and wrongly categorized properties incorrectly registered on the Council's records

The solution comprised compiling, cleansing, linking and matching critical datasets from the Council and other sources (Companies House, Yell, The Charity Commission, LPS Pointer data, Water Data, etc.). Additionally, Randomized Control Trials were proposed to determine the best communication methods to improve registrations and payment compliance.

## Challenges

- The availability and affordability of obligatory datasets required for the data hub
- The amount and quality of data obtained

To improve result accuracy, advanced record matching algorithms for normalizing and cleansing the data were proposed, with a history of these changes maintained to increase the quality of all new data entering the hub.

## Outcomes

- Successfully identified more than 4,500 presently unregistered properties
- This potentially equates to a 26.5% increase in business rate revenue
- Confirmed the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial to improve registration rates and payment compliance
