Onepoint Consulting worked with architects at Travis Perkins to create an architecture repository meta model based on ArchiMate (https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate2-doc/) and TOGAF (https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/). ArchiMate was used as the Architecture Definition Language to model business processes, business functions, applications, technology, data, goals, objectives among others, and architecture viewpoints. Business Model Canvas was used to model the high level business strategy in terms of customers, products, revenue stream, value propositions etc.

Sparx Enterprise Architect was used as the Enterprise Architecture Management tool to model, collaborate and populate the architecture repository.

In addition to supporting Travis Perkins with modelling the current architecture, Onepoint consultants were instrumental in shaping Travis Perkins’ application integration strategy and defining the high level conceptual data model.

Onepoint
consultants used the defined architecture content meta model to produce
current architecture models for 3 businesses (Travis Perkins, Wickes and
Benchmarx). These models provide a common understanding of how the
businesses currently operate and the solutions required for transition
to the planned future state.

The Application
Integration strategy enabled Travis Perkins to select an Application
Integration product and provided a set of best practices for selecting
and designing applications and data services.

The conceptual data
model served as a key enabler to define the common business vocabulary
and the initial set of required data services.
