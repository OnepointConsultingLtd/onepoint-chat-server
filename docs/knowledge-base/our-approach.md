### Design thinking

Design Thinking is part of the initial steps for the Rapid Value MethodTMwhich aims to help you solve complex problems. We can ensure a deep understanding of your business and challenges from different angles by:

- Understanding your users and systems
- Defining and reframing your business problem
- Discovering ideas for PoCs
- Designing prototypes or PoCs to prove value
- Evolving road-maps for your products and/or solutions

### Enterprise architecture

By adopting a simple and pragmatic approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) that’s right for you, we’ll help your organisation benefit from:

- Greater agility
- Operational efficiency
- Informed business change
- Aligned business and IT functions
- Improved interoperability, standardisation and integration
- Faster speed to market
- Reduced costs
- Secure and compliant technology
- Reduced technical risk

### DevOps

DevOps (Development & Operations) aims to automate the development and operations process through cross-functional collaboration.  It could be seen like  ‘agile’ but with operations included. The challenge is building a culture of collaboration between software development and IT teams that may have been working in relative siloes.

The goal is to create a continuous cycle of integration, delivery and deployment and has the following benefits:

- Better agility > better fit with the expectations
- Faster deployments > shorter time to market, fast feedback
- More automation > fewer errors
- Better testing and security > greater reliability
