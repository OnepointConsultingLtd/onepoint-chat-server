# Automotive Architecture Transformation Client

## Overview
Our client is the leading European provider of automotive data, insight and business intelligence services to global manufacturers, insurers, dealers, bodyshops and fleet and finance companies.

## Business Challenge
Due to intense competitive market pressures, the client needed a comprehensive audit of its business model and supporting technology strategy. The new senior management was tasked with creating a transformational roadmap to expand the business and streamline global operations, primarily in Europe.

The existing technological capabilities couldn't support the strategic business goals due to underinvestment. While multiple initiatives were addressing specific technology gaps, many were temporary tactical fixes lacking a holistic or strategically sustainable approach.

## Project Objectives
The Application & Data Architecture Transformation aimed to deliver a holistic target architecture that would:

- Support faster implementation of new products and services for customers
- Enable transition to online transactional systems
- Deliver functional, component, and deployment architecture
- Facilitate greater use of IT assets across the business
- Enable gradual migration via a high-level roadmap
- Balance regional and central business requirements
- Be pragmatic and business-driven rather than technology-driven
