### NRT Key Performance Indicator Case Study

Network Rail Telecom (NRT) is Network Rail’s national telecoms asset management and service provision division. It provides telecommunication network services to Network Rail and the passenger and freight operating companies it serves. NRT was created to form a single, unified telecoms organisation to improve the effectiveness of deployment and use of resources. NRT presently owns all of the company’s telecoms assets on the network side of the service demarcation point. Based in Milton Keynes, the HQ of Network Rail alongside other Network Rail services, NRT currently employs some 3,000 specialist telecommunications workers.

- To establish NRT as the rail industry’s
  number one service provider of choice and to expand operations to
  become a significant player within the UK telecommunications sector.
- The performance
  indicators used should be ‘living’, implying the need to replace or
  reframe the indicators as the business matures and strategic priorities
  change, both within individual business areas and collectively as a
  tier-one telecommunications business.

- or the performance indicators across the NRT business to be integrated.
- To devise clearly measurable indicators which can be tracked through robust standard operating procedures and ultimately automated. This will allow a more comprehensive management of the business, enabling universal communication, including the acceptance or rebuttal of performance parameters derived from external suppliers and collaborators of NRT.
- To select the key 3-5 KPIs that best represent the responsibilities of each NRT business division – performance parameters which make sense to the intended audience.
- To transform NRT from an asset based organisation to a service centric organisation.

Through interviews with NRT business area leaders and their report facilitators, and a review of documents made available to us, we analysed NRT’s current KPIs with a view to determining how information was monitored and assessed. This enables us to identify which of the current KPIs used by the SLT can be improved.

To address the observations and implications, we analysed how the NRT’s KPIs could be improved, leading to the creation of a ‘Strawman’ balanced scorecard systems and constructive suggestions for improvements in terms of MI reporting.

In our consultations with NRT business area leaders and data facilitators, and during our document review, we collated a list of potential factors to be measured (including some ‘wish list’ measures) which could be used to enhance SLT reporting.

We created a simple spreadsheet to capture and analyse the long list of potential measures.

By de-duplicating and removing measures lacking in data maturity, we redacted the list to ashortlist of optimum KPIs.

Our review also identified other reports, particularly those directed to the executive, which can be closely aligned with the SLT reports.

The plain language questions asked throughout the interview process provided a suitable context to the indicators and management information (MI) being provided. In effect this aided in explaining the meaning of each measure being used, leading to a more thorough understanding by each and every department and subunit within NRT. Implementing the ‘Strawman’ approach affords a standardised approach to measuring the agreed KPIs for each function, in contrast to the prior metrics which were not previously aligned with the goals and objectives of the individual departments.

The Strawman Consulting Technique afforded the following benefits:

- A standardised approach
- The streamlining of priorities
