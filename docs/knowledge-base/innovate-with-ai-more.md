## GEN AI & MORE

### How have you integrated GenAI in your business?

Most organisations see AI's potential. But turning vision into reality is often a challenge.

Fragmented data landscapes, legacy system constraints, limited internal expertise, and insufficient governance are some of the hurdles that need to be overcome.

That's why we created a suite of accelerators, expert services, and free AI tools to help our clients to create competitive advantage through AI.

## AI EXPERT SERVICES

### Realising the business value of AI, with expert guidance

Whether you need support with use case definition, data architecture, model development, or anything in between, our AI experts have the skills, experience, methods, and toolkits to transform your vision into reality. Let us be your strategic partner in unlocking the full potential of AI within your organisation.

#### Uncovering your most impactful AI opportunities

Identifying the right starting point for AI can be the biggest challenge in driving tangible business value.

Our AI Discovery service helps you overcome that hurdle, empowering you to pinpoint the use cases with the greatest potential impact.

With a clear path forward and a firm grasp on your most impactful AI possibilities, you'll be equipped to move decisively from ambition to execution.

#### Accelerating AI from idea to implementation

Turning AI ambitions into tangible solutions requires more than just conceptual planning — it demands the ability to rapidly transform ideas into working prototypes. That's precisely what our AI Prototype service delivers.

Leveraging our proprietary Onepoint AI Engine™ and a broad toolkit of frameworks and platforms from the AI ecosystem, we develop minimum viable AI prototypes to validate feasibility and value.

With a proven prototype in hand, you will have the confidence and the foundation needed to prove your business case, get funded, and transform your AI vision into a full-fledged product or enterprise capability.

#### Intelligent solutions powered by our AI engine

AI-powered agents and assistants are transforming the way organisations interact with customers, empower employees, and optimise operations. But off-the-shelf solutions often fall short of meeting your unique requirements.

That's where our AI Custom Agents and Companions service comes in. Leveraging our proprietary Onepoint AI Engine™, we will work hand-in-hand with you to design and develop AI-driven solutions perfectly tailored to your specific business needs.

Whether you are looking to revolutionise the customer experience, empower your workforce, or optimise critical business functions, our custom AI offerings deliver tangible value — powered by the capabilities of our proven Onepoint AI Engine™.

#### Your fast-track to production-ready AI

Realising AI's business impact demands both specialised technical know-how and a clearly defined roadmap to production. Our AI Springboard service provides both, delivering a ready-to-deploy AI solution tailored to your specific needs.

Leveraging our proprietary Onepoint AI Engine™ and industry-honed implementation frameworks, we work closely with your team to:

- Design a scalable AI architecture optimised for your data and systems;
- Develop production-grade AI models trained on your unique requirements;
- Integrate the solution seamlessly into your existing technology stack; and
- Provide comprehensive testing, documentation, and knowledge transfer.

With your custom AI Springboard in place, you will have a powerful, production-ready foundation to accelerate time-to-value and drive transformative business outcomes.

#### Scaling your AI initiatives to enterprise-grade impact

You have identified the right AI use cases, developed impactful prototypes, and have a production-ready solution. But the journey does not end there. Achieving sustainable, large-scale business value from AI requires specialised expertise in deployment, integration, and scaling.

That's where our AI Deploy & Scale service comes in. We will partner with you to seamlessly transition your AI initiatives from pilot to enterprise-wide or real-world implementation, handling the complexities so you can focus on driving monumental outcomes.

#### Realising continuous value from your AI investments

Achieving sustainable, long-term impact from your AI initiatives requires more than just skilled deployment. It demands ongoing optimisation, maintenance, and strategic guidance for the latest tools, applications, and best practices for security and ethics. That's precisely what our AI Managed service provides.

With Onepoint as your managed AI services provider, you can focus on driving transformative business outcomes, while we handle the complex tasks of sustaining high-performing, future-ready AI solutions. It's AI success, managed for you.
