## AI holds the key to unlocking the immense potential of 'dark' company data​

Most businesses are sitting on a treasure trove. Unstructured elements like images, sound recordings, and various forms of text are hidden in plain sight throughout company systems, with untapped potential for insights and innovation.

AI can revolutionise how we understand and create value from this data.

At Onepoint, we are at the forefront of this exciting journey, delving into the myriad of new ways AI can enhance our interaction with data.

Some of our exploration into these groundbreaking developments is chronicled in our AI evangelist Gil Fernandes’s blog.

## Reset and clear your mind

with traffic control for the office

Many of us at Onepoint HQ benefit from a daily practice of regular short meditations suitable for even the busiest data-ist. It’s a method called ‘traffic control’, helping to control the seemingly endless, and often unhelpful, traffic of thoughts that go through the mind. It’s very effective, helping you to remain calm, contented and effective no matter what the day throws at you.
